DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING

CEPSTRAL WAVELET COEFFICIENTS FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION

The proposal aims at the design, training and operation of a neural network, which identifies the voice and the dictation of the name of each member of the work team, evidenced through a visual response through a mobile phone. This system consists of different stages of processing the audio of the interlocutors, such as fractionating the voice signal and filtering it with specific techniques. After processing the audio signal, a series of algorithms are implemented to carry out wavelet transformation (adaptation and analysis of signals), calculating the energy of the bands and separation of the vocal identification fragments of that signal. Finally, the neural network training is performed by providing a series of master audios. The series of tasks mentioned above, result in a system capable of detecting the voice of the members of the work team, in the same way identifying each of them with a high rate of effectiveness.
